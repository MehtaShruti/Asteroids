Prediction of asteroids as hazardous and non-hazardous using Deep Neural Network

Classification of potentially hazardous asteroids using Deep Neural Network (TensorFlow)
• Wrangled and pre-processed data from NASA API to classify asteroids as potentially hazardous and non-hazardous
• Trained Deep Neural Network to classify hazardous asteroids in close vicinity of Earth with performance accuracy of 84%

This reaearch was presented in the "Young Scholar's Conference" on Big Data in Stem at Brown University.
